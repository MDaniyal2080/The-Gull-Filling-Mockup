## Cold Outreach (Value‑First)
Subject: {BusinessName} → a clean, fast site that matches your brand

Hi {FirstName},

I love what you’re building with {BusinessName} in Houston — the clean, approachable food voice and the red cutlery logo stand out. I help food creators turn social traffic into bookings, subscribers, and cookbook sales with fast, trustworthy websites.

Here’s what I’d ship for you:
- Home, Services, Recipes/Blog, Cookbooks, Gallery, About, Contact
- Booking/inquiry form with email notifications
- Local SEO and rich recipe metadata
- Newsletter integration and Instagram feed embed
- Launched on your domain, optimized for speed and mobile

To keep everything safe and legit, I work through Fiverr (escrow + verified profiles): {FiverrProfileURL}

Would you like a 1‑page mini mockup (free) to see the look? If yes, I’ll send a Fiverr Custom Offer so the process stays protected and transparent.

Best,
{YourName}
{YourRole}
Portfolio: {PortfolioURL}

Last note from me unless you’d like to continue. I can hold a build slot until {OfferExpiryDate}. If it’s not the right time, no worries — I can revisit later. If it is, I’ll send a Fiverr Custom Offer so it’s all protected and simple.

Appreciate your time,
{YourName}
